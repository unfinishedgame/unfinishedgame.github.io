# My Website
My website is a website made by me. It's a place where I can put code that I write. Unlike the majority of coders, I actually like using JavaScript, so I mess around with it a lot. I wanted a place to put all the stuff I write in it, so here we go!

Don't expect any consistency, effort, or just general usability.



Note: I had to delete the old one because it wasn't letting me upload my changes, but there wasn't really anything in there and I was the only one who ever saw it anyway so it shouldn't really matter
